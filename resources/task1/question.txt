In a folder, have some files in .txt format. Read the contents of the file and remove the words if they are printed more than once successively. Example: "Read a file file file" has to be converted to "Read a file".
Create 10 threads and do the above processing in a parallel manner.
If the number of files is less than 10, then create number of threads equal to the number of files. Example: If there is only one file in the folder then create only one thread.
Print the total time taken for execution.
